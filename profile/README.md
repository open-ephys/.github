## Open Ephys
Open Ephys is an employee-owned cooperative based in Altanta, Georgia, with team members distributed all around the world. 
We work with the Open Ephys Production Site, located in Lisbon, Portugal, to distribute high-quality open-source tools for 
cutting-edge neuroscience research. Our mission is to advance our understanding of the brain by promoting community ownership 
of the tools we use to study it. Since Open Ephys was founded in 2014, weâ€™ve made it possible to build an entire extracellular 
electrophysiology rig from off-the-shelf open-source components. We are just getting started on our journey and welcome community
contributions!
